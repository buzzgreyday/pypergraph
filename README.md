# Pypergraph: Python SDK for Constellation Network
---

Pypergraph is a Python package that enables secure wallet functionalities and interaction with Constellation Network APIs. Inspired by DAG for JavaScript ([DAG4JS](https://github.com/StardustCollective/dag4.js)).

> ⚠️ **Caution:** This package is currently in alpha. Changes will happen rapidly, as I develop.
  **Do not use it for production purposes** as it may contain bugs or incomplete features. Contributions are welcome—please contact me if you'd like to get involved.
